# Tahrget Brand Guide

## Name

**Tahrget** (pronounced "target")

- **Tahr**: Himalayan mountain goat
- **Target**: You're targeting objects for detection. Also targeting your goal, not getting lost in ML weeds.
- **GOAT**: Implicit "Greatest Of All Time" energy. Never said outright.

---

## Core Positioning

**Primary message:** Speed to prototype.

You have an idea. You have 2 images. You don't want to become an ML engineer to validate it. Tahrget gets you from idea to working model fast.

**The energy:** "Just fucking get to it."

No dataset gathering. No fine-tuning rabbit holes. No ML PhD required. Upload, describe, deploy.

---

## Target Audience

Startups, indie hackers, product teams who need ML but don't want ML to become their job.

People who:
- Have an idea to validate
- Have minimal reference images
- Don't have months to spend on data collection
- Don't want to learn YOLO, SAM, fine-tuning internals
- Need a working prototype, not a research project

---

## Voice & Tone

**Direct.** Say it once, say it clearly.

**Impatient with friction.** We hate busywork, you hate busywork, let's skip it.

**No jargon.** Not "leveraging state-of-the-art vision transformers." Just "it works."

**Respects your time.** Short docs. Fast onboarding. No bullshit.

**Confident.** We know this works. No hedging.

### Examples

**Good:**
> "Two images. One model. Ship it."

> "You describe what to detect. We handle the rest."

> "Idea to edge-deployed model. Hours, not months."

**Bad:**
> "Leverage our cutting-edge SAM3-powered annotation pipeline with YOLOv11 fine-tuning capabilities."

> "We're excited to announce our industry-leading synthetic data generation platform."

## Supporting Themes

Use these angles in different contexts:

| Angle | Use when |
|-------|----------|
| **Generate from minimal data** | Explaining the magic - 2 images become a full dataset |
| **No manual labeling** | Comparing to traditional ML workflow pain |
| **Edge deployment** | Technical audience, IoT/robotics use cases |
| **Precision** | When accuracy matters (manufacturing, agriculture) |

### The Goat Connection

Subtle, not mascot-heavy:

- **Speed/agility** - goats are nimble, so is prototyping with Tahrget
- **Cliff edge → edge devices** - a nice visual metaphor
- **Hard to reach → hard to collect data** - you generate what's impractical to gather
- **Sure-footed** - doesn't miss detections

---

## Visual Direction

**Clean and minimal.** Not startup-playful, not enterprise-boring.

**Logo:** Logomark, not mascot. Consider:
- Abstract horn silhouette
- Geometric tahr shape
- Crosshair + horn fusion
- Simple, works at 16x16

**Color:** TBD. Avoid generic startup blue. Something distinctive but professional.

**Typography:** Clean sans-serif. Nothing quirky.

**Goat theming:** Subtle. Logo nods to it. Maybe easter eggs in product. Not goats everywhere.

## Tagline Options

Primary contenders:
- "Idea to model. Fast."
- "Two images. One model. Go."
- "Skip the dataset. Ship the prototype."
- "Upload. Describe. Deploy."

Supporting copy:
- "Custom object detection without the custom timeline."
- "ML prototyping at startup speed."
- "You have the idea. We have the shortcut."

---

## Marketing

### Channels
Multi-channel with tooling to stay active everywhere:
- Twitter/X (dev community)
- LinkedIn (business buyers)
- Reddit (r/MachineLearning, r/computervision)
- YouTube (demo videos)
- Content/SEO (tutorials, use cases)

### Self-Referential Demo

Launch with goat-themed content made by the product:
- Generate mountain goat dataset from 2 reference images
- Train detection model
- Show tracking in video
- "This demo was made with Tahrget"

The marketing IS the product demo.

### Content Ideas
- "From iPhone photo to edge model in 20 minutes" tutorials
- Use case spotlights (agriculture, manufacturing, robotics)
- Comparison: traditional ML workflow vs Tahrget
- "What can you build with 2 images?" series

---

## Reference Brands

Brands whose energy we like:
- **Linear** - opinionated, beautiful, no BS
- **Vercel** - "ship faster" simplicity
- **Raycast** - polished, trusts the user
- **Apple** - confidence, simplicity, "it just works"

We're not copying these. We're scrappier, more startup-energy. But the respect-your-intelligence vibe applies.
