# Branding

## Overview

Apply Tahrget brand guidelines to all marketing and PR content. Ensures consistent voice, messaging, and positioning across all materials.

## Core Positioning

**Primary message:** Speed to prototype.

**The energy:** "Just fucking get to it." No ML PhD required. Upload, describe, deploy.

**Audience:** Startups, indie hackers, product teams who need ML but don't want ML to become their job.

## Voice Quick Reference

- **Direct** - say it once, say it clearly
- **Impatient with friction** - skip the busywork
- **No jargon** - "it works" not "leveraging state-of-the-art"
- **Respects time** - short, fast, no bullshit
- **Confident** - no hedging

### Good Examples
- "Two images. One model. Ship it."
- "You describe what to detect. We handle the rest."
- "Idea to edge-deployed model. Hours, not months."

### Bad Examples
- "Leverage our cutting-edge SAM3-powered annotation pipeline..."
- "We're excited to announce our industry-leading..."

## When Writing Content

1. Read the full brand guide in `references/brand-guide.md` for complete guidelines
2. Match voice to context (technical audience vs business buyer)
3. Keep goat/GOAT references subtle - implicit energy, not explicit mentions
4. Prioritize clarity over cleverness

## Supporting Angles

Use different angles based on context:

| Angle | Best for |
|-------|----------|
| Generate from minimal data | Explaining the core value |
| No manual labeling | Comparing to traditional workflow |
| Edge deployment | Technical/IoT audiences |
| Precision | Manufacturing, agriculture use cases |
